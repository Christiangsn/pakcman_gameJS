## 💻 Project

A game entirely made in JavaScript inspired by the famous <a href="https://www.jogos360.com.br/pac_man.html">Packman</a> game.
The central objective of the game is to capture as many monsters as possible that will randomly appear on your screen. 
While you try to capture them, you can see a counter of how many monsters you have captured so far.
